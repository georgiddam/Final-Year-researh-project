D3js and jQuery library imports are used in this project. https://d3js.org/ , https://jquery.com/
This project is highly based on the Levenshtein distance algorithm

The Corpus of this CO620 project consists of the code used to generate the results discussed in the report. 

In order to run the code, all is required to have internet connection due to the use of cdnjs imports for the libraries mentioned above. 
If there is no internet connection, the libraries will have to be installed locally https://jquery.com/download/ , https://github.com/d3/d3/releases 

Once any of these criteria are met, the user has to run the basic.html file located in the root directory of this file using a browser and type a keyword in the field then click render.

There is a video Introduction.mp4 that can be ran to look at how it all works.

If database change is required, inside the Data folder are all databases I have used during this project. A user will have to go edit the basic.html file on line 19, and change the name or directory of the database
The line will look something like this "<script src="data/phpbb2.js"></script>
